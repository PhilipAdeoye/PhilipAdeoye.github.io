                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Through answering a series of gradually narrowing questions, The Car Wizard gets to know the user's needs, desires, and aspirations,
                    and provides a very short list of cars that would be perfect for them. Thus eliminating the burden of
                    a manual search across all possible makes and models while preserving a user's right to choose.
                </p>

                <h3>Design Process</h3>

                <br>
                <h4>Data Gathering</h4>
                <p>
                    Led by me, my team conducted several <strong>semi-structured interviews</strong> with people who had
                    recently purchased cars that they found via the internet to learn about what their experiences were.
                    We also conducted <strong>direct observations</strong> with people who were actively looking to purchase
                    a car to find out how they conducted the task.
                </p>

                <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
                <h5>Affinity Diagram</h5>
                <p>
                    Creating an affinity diagram revealed different aspects of things people think about when car shopping such as convenience
                    and safety features, reviews, pricing data, emotional choices...
                </p>

                <br>
                <h5>Empathy Map</h5>
                <p>
                    "Emotionally grueling" is how I remember the process of empathy mapping. Saying the words, "I don't know where to start,"
                    "I feel helpless," and others like it centered us and quickened our resolve to find a soothing solution.
                </p>
                <br>
                <a href="../images/car_guy_empathy_map.png" target="_blank">
                <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/car_guy_empathy_map.png" alt="Empathy Map"

                </a>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Our analysis revealed general themes of </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="text-danger">helplessness</span> (from having to do the search by themselves)</li>
                    <li><span class="text-danger">fear</span> (of making the wrong choice due the sheer number of options available)</li>
                    <li><span class="text-danger">distrust</span> (dealerships are out to get them)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    To have an even firmer grasp of these feelings, we created <strong>personas</strong> to distinctly embody
                    them and give the team a human focus of this tragedy.
                </p>
                <br>

                        <p>
                            Sergey is new to the US. He is a masters student from Toulouse, France and has only been in the states for a little over
                            a month. He has heard of how brutal Indianapolis winters can be, and although the cold doesn't
                            bother him, he's concerned he might be bothering his friends when he asks them for rides to the
                            store.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sergey wants to be able to explore the city and venture into the countryside to enjoy the imminent fall festivals. He also
                            wants to be able to give rides to some other friends who may need to get around.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While he was in Toulouse before moving to Indy, Sergey owned a Ford Fiesta and really enjoyed driving it around, he also
                            feels that it brought him good luck. So far, Sergey hasn't had much good luck finding a car in
                            Indy. He has a hard maximum on his budget and is looking to get a small car that he can easily
                            park in the city. He would rather not deal with dealerships and is very wary of classified ads.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He has tried buying directly from manufacturer's websites, but found out that in Indiana, direct sales from manufacturers
                            to consumers are forbidden by law. Sergey needs a stress free way to get into a nice hatchback
                            before the cold winds of winter blow down from the North.

                <h4>Ideation</h4>
                <p>
                    Of the many ideas we generated through <strong>brainstorming</strong>, we picked the ones that guided
                    users, quickly honed in on suitable options, and were reassuring to users. The fusion of those qualities
                    is the essence of The Car Wizard.

                <h4>Playing with Paper</h4>
                <p>
                    Building a paper prototype to test out our idea was a fun learning experience which allowed us to think through each step
                    that a potential user would take and to focus on making sure that the affordances that our product had
                    were clearly indicated.

                <h4>Testing</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Cognitive Walkthroughs</strong> of representative tasks and <strong>think-alouds</strong> with
                    users informed us that the concept for The Car Wizard is solid and usable, but its success would lie
                    with how pertinent the questions it asks are. Essentially, the design is good, but its content, which
                    we did not tackle, would decide whether it would succeed or not.
