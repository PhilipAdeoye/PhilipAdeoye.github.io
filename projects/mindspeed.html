                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    MINDSpeed is a research project that aims to promote graceful and dignified aging by facilitating the consumption of brain-healthy
                    foods and the playing of mentally-stimulating games. On this project, I joined a UX team that had already
                    done preliminary research to dicover the users (adults 65 and older) as well as their eating and device
                    usage habits. Each member of the team
                    <strong>contributed design ideas and interactive prototypes</strong> which we critiqued and <strong>tested with users</strong>                    to discover the right blend. Following this, I <strong>built a web application</strong> to implement
                    the ideas that worked best for our users.
                </p>

                <h3>Design Process</h3>

                    <li>Sketching</li>
                    <li>Low Fidelity Prototype</li>
                    <li>High Fidelity Prototype</li>

                    <li>Software Development</li>
                </ol>
                <br>

                <h4>Review User Research</h4>
                <p>
                    Reviewing the research conducted by the team revealed two major goals: <strong>enable users to order
                    brain-healthy meals</strong> and <strong>incentivize meal reporting</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>The research also revealed that MINDSpeed had to be <strong>super simple to use</strong> because older adults
                    have no patience for complicated workflows, <strong>use familiar metaphors</strong>,
                    <strong>appear friendly</strong>, and be approachable.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4>Sketching</h4>
                <p><strong>First Round</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I started off with some quick sketching to get ideas out of my head. In doing so, I played around with creating a schedule
                    of meals for each week that the users would build. Also, they would be challenged with balancing a weekly
                    budget against getting a certain number of "brain points."

                    and getting suggestions on what meals could be created from them.

                <h4>User Testing</h4>
                <p>
                    The prototype was tested with eight participants who were able to complete the tasks we assigned, but we found several aspects
                    of the design that needed rethinking due to the facts that:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Participants routinely assumed that the brain points were calorie counts, which misled them towards minimizing what we hoped
                        they would maximize</li>
                    <li>
                        Staying within the budget while trying to reach the brain points goal was more difficult than we anticipated
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The cognitive burden from having to make so many decisions was unsustainable
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h4>MINDSpeed Web App</h4>
                <p>
                    Based on what we learned from the testing sessions, the team came up with an improved design that removed the complexity
                    of previous designs, preserved the user's ability to make informed choices, and incentivized healthy
                    eating.

                <h4>Next Steps</h4>
                <p>
                    To further refine the application, the team intends to conduct some think-alouds with potential users. We are also planning
                    to conduct taste tests to find out which of our meals people find palatable. Beyond these will come the
                    real test when participants start using MINDSpeed to order the meals that they will eat everyday while
                    part of their three month stint in the four year MINDSpeed research study.
