                survey the 100 methods of design outlined in <a title="Amazon link to Universal Methods of Design" href="https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Methods-Design-Innovative-Effective/dp/1592537561">
                Martin and Hannington's Universal Methods of Design</a>. For 100 consecutive days, I learn one new method

                The recommended steps in the Contextual Design playbook are:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                       <strong>Contextual Inquiry</strong>. A method of data gathering where designers are embedded in
                       the users' world and get to observe and query what users' experiences. More on Contextual Inquiry
                       tomorrow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <strong>Interpretation Sessions</strong> are structured debriefing sessions for each customer
                       contextual inquiry. These sessions involve not only designers but business people, developers, etc.
                       They are intended to enrich the process by getting a multitude of multidisciplinary views.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Work Models and Affinity Diagrams</strong>. Work models allow the team to model the data
                        around aspects of life and work. <strong>Flow</strong> models capture the "flow" of information, and
                        <strong>sequence</strong> models represent the temporal relationship between various tasks that
                        occur. <strong>Artifact, Cultural, and Physical</strong> are other work models that can be used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Visioning</strong> and <strong>Storyboarding</strong> take the work models and use them
                        for generating concepts and working out the details.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>User Environment Design</strong> reimagines (from a high level) a new way and flow of work
                        for the users. It documents the structure, function, and flow between "places" in the system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Paper Mock-ups</strong> are then used to get feedback from customers on the structure,
                        function, and flow of the proposed design before it is coded and implemented.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Contextual Design spans the entire design process except for implementation at the end. Holtzblatt and
                Beyer's book <i>Contextual Design: A Customer-Centered Approach to Systems Design</i>, and Holtzblatt's
                follow up book <i>Contextual Design Evolved</i>, which updates the framework for how technology use is
                evolving, are excellent resources for doing contextual design.
