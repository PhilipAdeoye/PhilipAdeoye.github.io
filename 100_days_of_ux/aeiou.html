                AEIOU is a method that provides ethnographic researchers with a framework for recording and classifying 
                observations and information about their subject's Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, and 
                Users.

                AEIOU is Day 2 of <a href="index.html" title="100 Days of UX">100 Days of UX</a>, an exploratory effort to 
                survey the 100 methods of design outlined in <a title="Amazon link to Universal Methods of Design" href="https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Methods-Design-Innovative-Effective/dp/1592537561">
                Martin and Hannington's Universal Methods of Design</a>. For 100 consecutive days, I learn one new method
                a day and write about it.

                <p>
                The aforementioned definition is my interpretation. The formal definition is that AEIOU is an 
                organizational framework reminding the researcher to attend to, document, and code 
                information under a guiding taxonomy of Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, and Users. 
                </p>

                <strong>Activities</strong> are the actions people take towards a goal, the paths they follow, and the 
                modes they work in.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                <strong>Environments</strong> are the spaces where the activities take place. Look for what the atmosphere
                and context are like. How about the spaces? Are they shared or individual? How have the people adapted the 
                environment for their own use, etc?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                <strong>Interactions</strong> are between a person and someone else or thing. Interactions are the 
                building blocks of activities. Look out for people's routines, special interactions between individuals,
                groups, objects in the environment and across distance and time.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                <strong>Objects</strong> are the building blocks of the environment. Look out for how objects are put to 
                use and how they can take on unexpected uses depending on the context and actions.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                <strong>Users</strong> are the people whose behaviors, preferences, and needs are being observed. Look 
                out for their values, biases, roles, relationships, etc
                </p>
                <hr>               
                
                
                <h3>Doing It</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Gather materials (photos, notes, videos, interviews, etc) via ethnographic methods
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During field work, use the AEIOU framework to "observe" the environment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Record observations under appropriate headings
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Review and cluster observations to reveal higher-level themes and patterns. This part sounds a 
                        lot like <a href="affinity_diagramming.html">Affinity Diagramming</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                On a final note, it is important to keep in mind that although AEIOU prescribes categories for 
                observation and coding, these can be expanded and built on depending on the researcher's needs.
