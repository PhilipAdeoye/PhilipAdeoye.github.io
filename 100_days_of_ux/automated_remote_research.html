                Remote Research comes in two flavors: <strong>Automated</strong> and <strong>Moderated</strong>. 
                To better illustrate the difference between both, a 
                fishing analogy would be apt. Automated remote research is akin to using a trawler to scoop up the fish
                from the sea while the fishers chill out in their heated cabin, while Remote Moderated Research would be
                using a pole to grab each individual fish.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Another way to look at the difference in flavors is in the nature of the data we get. Moderated lets us 
                find out <strong>what we don't know </strong> (by observing/questioning behavior and context) while 
                Automated lets us <strong>test our assumptions</strong> on specific questions.

                <p>
                Automated Remote Research can help researchers collect quantitative data about questions such as
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Are participants able to perform a certain task on the website?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If so, how long does it take them to complete the task?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If they have trouble completing the task, where are they abandoning the process?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What is the most common click path that users take through the interface to complete a task?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Benefits</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It is very flexible. Data can be acquired from all over the globe at any time and there is the
                        potential for getting a more diverse set of users than otherwise possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users are able to contribute data in their natural environments doing their regular tasks.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Does not work when interaction with the user is necessary
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the test materials need to be confidential, automated testing might be problematic
                    </li>
                </ul>
