                Artifact Analysis is the study of <strong>how people use and conceptualize objects</strong>. It is an
                examination of the <strong>object's qualities</strong> to better understand its users and the culture in
                which it typically exists.

                The components of an artifact analysis are the:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Material</strong> analysis which queries physical characteristic such as material
                        composition, durability, wear patterns, disposability, etc, and asks questions like: <strong>What</strong>
                        material is this made of? <strong>How</strong> was this constructed? and How easy would it be to
                        repair this?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Aesthetic</strong> analysis which includes a subjective visual assessment as well as
                        questions about historical references and emotional meaning. Questions like: <strong>How</strong>
                        valuable is this? <strong>Could</strong> this be currently trendy? Could this ever have been
                        trendy? are appropriate here.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An <strong>interactive</strong> analysis which addresses the object's affordances and operational
                        use: Is/was the object ever functional, instrumental, shared, individual, and so on. Questions
                        like: Could this object be customized by its owner? <strong>What</strong> else could this object
                        be used for? and so on.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <br>
                <p>
                As we can see, artifact analysis involves asking a lot of how, why, and what questions. Some of these
                are available in this <a href="http://dlrtoolkit.com/assets/resources/artifact-questionnaire.pdf"
                    title="Artifact Questionnaire">Artifact Questionnaire by Noah Litvin of Design Led Research Toolkit.</a>
                Other less involved questionnaires are available depending on the researcher's needs.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Some advantages of artifact analysis are that it does not require human participants, can yield
                unexpected insights, and it may be used to study people/cultures across both time and space.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Some disadvantages are that ones findings are not always as easy or feasible to confirm, one is
                limited to available artifacts, and one runs the distinct risk of applying their cultural biases.
                </p>
