                Competitive testing can reveal market opportunities, gaps in competitors' offerings, pricing strategies,
                among many other things. Competitive Usability Testing, which is focused on usability can help the team
                evaluate future features, examine similar features, and discover better ways to do things.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                It can be quite tedious though, especially if there are many competitors and the breadth of their offerings
                is large.

                <p>
                In conducting a competitive usability testing session with users:
                </p>                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Use the think-aloud methodology to get them to say what they are thinking while using the 
                        competitors product
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If testing against multiple competitors, in order to eliminate order effects, alternate the 
                        sequence with which the participants use the products
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Test against products that you know are good and potentially interesting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Try not to inadvertently bias your participants. It is sometimes helpful if they did not know
                        what product or company you represent
                    </li>
                </ul>
