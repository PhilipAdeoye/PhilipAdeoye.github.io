                The Cognitive Walkthrough is a usability inspection method that evaluates a system's relative ease of use
                in situations where preparatory instruction, coaching, or training on the system is unlikely to occur.

                Cognitive walkthroughs are useful for inspecting systems where a person must be able to actively engage
                with an interface and know what to do next without relying on any preexisting knowledge of the system.
                Cognitive walkthroughs are a test to find out if the common assumptions and mental models that people
                have about computing systems were taken into consideration during the design.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Cognitive walkthroughs are particularly well-suited for evaluating "walk up and use" systems such as
                ATMs, automated parking garage ticketing machines, etc.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                The trademark of the cognitive walkthrough method are the four yes/no learning theory based questions
                asked of the system being inspected. There are several formulations of those questions, but each
                formulation eventually asks the same thing.

                From Martin and Hannington:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Will users want to produce whatever effect the action has?</li>
                    <li>Will users see the control (button, menu, label, etc) for the action?</li>
                    <li>Once users find the control, will they recognize that it will produce the effect they want?</li>
                    <li>After the action is taken, will users understand the feedback they get, so they can confidently
                        continue on to the next action?</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>
                Or from a super helpful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Edqjao4mmxM" title="Sample Cognitive Walkthrough">video by Chris Kimmer on cognitive walkthroughs</a> I found on YouTube:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Will the user be trying to achieve the right effect?</li>
                    <li>Is the action visible?</li>
                    <li>Will the user recognize the action as the correct one?</li>
                    <li>Will the user understand the feedback?</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>
                If all the answers are "yes," congratulations! If there are noes, take note of those and work to fix them.
