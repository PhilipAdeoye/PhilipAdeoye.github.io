                Unless observed, most people will summarize their work activities and speak abstractly about tasks,
                because typically their processes are invisible to them. Contextual Inquiry provides a way to structure
                interviews with people that expose specific details about how they work, and helps expose underlying
                work structure.

                <p>
                The four principles that define contextual inquiry are: Context, Partnership, Interpretation, and Focus.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                <strong>Context</strong> requires researchers to spend appreciable time embedded into the
                user's life or work in order to discover what actually happens in real-time and to query the user's actions,
                responses to stimuli, etc. It is a mix of observation and interviewing within the user's context.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                With contextual inquiry, the researcher and customer are engaged in an <strong>apprentice/master
                partnership</strong>. The customer is the master of their domain and the researcher is actively
                learning about their field and how the master works.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                As a session goes on, and researchers gain more knowledge about their customer's work, immediately
                <strong>interpreting</strong> what they notice for meaning and design implications is necessary. This
                also requires validating the interpretation with the customer as misinterpretations could lead to wrong
                design choices.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                During a session, the researcher must remain flexible and be able to alter their <strong>focus</strong>
                when they pick up new information.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                From personal experience, contextual inquiries can be done by an individual, but are so much easier with
                at least two people. One person to watch, prod, and probe the customer for information and another to
                simply be a notetaker who captures quotes, behaviors, etc.
                </p>
